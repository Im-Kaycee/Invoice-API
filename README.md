# üßæ Freelancer Invoice API

A lightweight, secure API built with **FastAPI** that allows freelancers to manage and generate invoices for their clients.

---

## üìå Project Purpose

Freelancers often juggle multiple projects and clients, making manual invoice generation error-prone and time-consuming. This API provides a simple backend to:

- Authenticate securely
- Create detailed invoices
- Associate multiple items to an invoice
- Download invoices
- Easily integrate with a future frontend or PDF generation service

---

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast Python web framework
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization
- **JWT**: Secure authentication using access tokens
- **SQLite / SQLAlchemy**: Lightweight, relational database setup

---

## üîê Features & Design Decisions

### 1. **User Registration & Login**
- üîê Users must register and log in to use the system.
- üõ° Authentication is handled with JWT tokens to secure endpoints.
- üéØ Decision: Keeps user-specific invoices private and secure.

### 2. **Invoice Management**
- üßæ Each invoice is tied to a specific authenticated user.
- üì¶ Invoices contain:
  - Client name/email
  - Due date
  - Status (`unpaid`, `paid`)
  - Multiple invoice items with quantity, unit price, subtotal
- üéØ Decision: This structure mirrors a real-world invoice layout and supports total calculation.

### 3. **Ownership Enforcement**
- üîê All endpoints are protected and user-specific.
- üéØ Decision: A user can only view or delete their own invoices, ensuring data isolation.

### 4. **Expandable Architecture**
- ‚úÖ Clean structure with separate routers and models.
- üìÑ A PDF download endpoint using `WeasyPrint`.
